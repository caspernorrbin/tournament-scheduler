## Communication Platform
This was the component that we ourselves implemented, its code resides in the `communication_platform` directory.

### Functionality
- Scheduling a single match
- Scheduling a round robin tournament between multiple players
- Saving and loading the state of individual match
- Simulating matches (can be easily replaced with real matches)

### Tests
`python -m unittest` runs all tests, alternatively, each test file can be run individually to test specific functionality.

## Running instructions
The main program can be run from `main.py`. To start  the program, run `python game.py`
