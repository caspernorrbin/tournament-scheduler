# Tournament Scheduler and Communication Platform
This project implements a communication platform for a nondescript game. The functionality includes:
- Scheduling a single match
- Scheduling a round robin tournament between multiple players
- Saving and loading the state of individual match
- Simulating matches (can be easily replaced with real matches)

## Running instructions
The main program can be run from `game.py`. To start  the program, run `python game.py`
`python -m unittest` runs all tests, alternatively, each test file can be run individually to test specific functionality
